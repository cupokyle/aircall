# Aircall

Aircall is a miniature simplistic concept app that mimics the call history on a user's phone. Using an API to retrieve fake data it builds a list of past phone calls and gives the user the option to see more details, or even archive each individual call. 

Once archived, a call can then be viewed under the archive tab where you can view more details and even un-archive a chosen call. This project was built in 24 hours using React.js. This was completed as a technical assessment.
